# e-commerce back end

## Description
I was assigned to create an application that would utilize mysql, CRUD and insomnia. Using the guise of an e-commerce back end, I was able to gain more experience with server instances and MySQL. This is also, I believe the most dependencies ive used at one time. My biggest challenge with this project was figuring out the model associations. The code makes sense but it was a little jumbled for me reading it and trying to figure it out at first.

## Installation
npm i to install the npms needed. 


## Usage
After installing the required nodes, either create and use the database in either workbench or in the terminal.
After that, seed the database and finally type 'npm run start' in the terminal and press enter to start the application. <br>
